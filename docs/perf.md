
## Some preliminary benchmarks

Some ad-hoc performance comparisons have been made [comparing both different web servers](web-performance.md); Mostly those kinds that rely on Libuv. Moreover, benchmarks are mainly focused towards
seeing commit-over-commit performance hits. Metrics in focus are really just _throughput_ and _latency_. Some
unstructured logs of benchmarks runs can be found in [performance.md](performance.md).
